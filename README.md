Api Blueprint
====================================

**Please Note:** *This package is in heavy development right now. Please wait till `1.0` version released, I will do my best to make it as soon as possible.

API Blueprint Parser for PHP.

API Blueprint is Web API documentation language. You can find API Blueprint documentation on the [API Blueprint site](https://apiblueprint.org/).

This package allows you to get [api blueprint AST](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint-ast) to work with. Based on this information you can do many useful things, like generate stubs for your API or validate API responses during development. Please note that this approach only useful when you write blueprint before implementing API.
